## 📊 Project Highlights

### ✅ Raw Data to Dashboard Workflow:
- **Power Query** used to clean the dataset:
  - Handled data type mismatches.
  - Filtered and shaped raw data as required.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand sales trends and target metrics.

### 📌 Key Features:
- **Interactive Dashboard Design**:
  - Built using Pivot Charts, Slicers, and KPIs.
  - KPI Cards: Total Sales, Total Orders, Profit Margin, Customer Count, Average Order Value.
  - Trendline: Quarterly Sales Trend.
  - Comparative Chart: Actual Sales vs Target Sales.
  - Segmented Analysis: Region vs Segment, Sales and Profit by Category/Sub-Category.
  - Choropleth Map: Order Count by U.S. State.

- **User Interactivity**:
  - Slicer filters for dynamic exploration (Year, Category, Sub-Category, Region, Segment).
  - Custom-designed **Filter Panel** using **Shapes + VBA** that mimics Power BI bookmarks:
    - Toggle panel visibility with a click for a clean UI experience.

- **VBA Integration**:
  - VBA script to **toggle the slicer panel visibility**.
  - VBA script to **refresh all Pivot Tables** dynamically.

- **Advanced Excel Functions** (demonstrated in supporting sheets):
  - `INDEX-MATCH` for reverse lookups.
  - `VLOOKUP` for customer-region mapping.
  - `IF`, `AND`, `OR` logic for flagging key metrics.
  - `TEXT`, `ROUND`, and `CONCATENATE` for KPI formatting.
